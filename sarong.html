  <p>Ocean inspired, the Menjagan Sarong is born from a genuine artistic
  journey. Menjangan Island is one of the most exquisite snorkelling site which
  is located in North of Bali. This unspoiled island with its colourful coral
  reef in a paradisiacal setting is also home to the green turtles. These
  oceanic treasures and beautiful creatures was a true source of inspiration for
  our designer.</p><p>Made with eco-luxe fabric with a bohemian twist this
  versatile sarong is a key piece to have in your day to day, holiday and travel
  wardrobe. Style it as skirt, a cute little beach resort dress, or why not
  dressing it up as a cape scarf or simply appreciating it as a boho decorative
  piece.</p>
