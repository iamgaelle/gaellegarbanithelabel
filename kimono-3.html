  <p>Our Karang Kimono is inspired by the Pink Beach in Komodo Island alongside
  the treasures that our Mother Ocean beholds: the word Karang literally
  translates to &ldquo;corals&rdquo; in the language of Bahasa in Indonesia. The
  hand-drawn illustrations with the soft and warm palette was selected to evoke
  dreamy visions of the tropical island wanderlust and beauty.</p><p>Embodying
  femininity and nature&rsquo;s beauty whilst effortlessly flowing with the
  breeze, this elegant kimono with a boho chic touch is the perfect cover up for
  your days chilling by the pool or at the beach. Or why not dress it up wearing
  it tight up with jeans or white trousers. The karang Kimono is not only a
  versatile key piece to have in your day-to-day, holiday and travel wardrobe
  but also feels so soft with its silky touch and comfortable to wear.</p>
