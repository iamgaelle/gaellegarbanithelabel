  <p>Ocean inspired, the Menjagan Sarong is born from a genuine artistic
  journey. Menjangan Island is one of the most exquisite snorkelling site which
  is located in North of Bali. This unspoiled island with its colourful coral
  reef in a paradisiacal setting is also home to the green turtles. These
  oceanic treasures and beautiful creatures was a true source of inspiration for
  our designer.</p><p>Made with eco-luxe fabric with a bohemian twist this
  versatile sarong is a key piece to have in your day to day, holiday and travel
  wardrobe. Style it as skirt, a cute little beach resort dress, or why not
  dressing it up as a cape scarf or simply appreciating it as a boho decorative
  piece.</p>
fabric-description_html: >-
  <p>Made of 100% TENCEL&trade; which is a certified biobased fiber extracted
  from renewable sources. The compostable and biodegradable fibers are produced
  from Eucalyptus pulp in an environmentally responsible closed-loop production
  process. 99% of the processed water and low-toxicity solvent are re-used,
  yielding very little by-product and leading to less land and water
  usage.</p><p>Our garments are produced in small batches and, because we care
  about Mother Nature, not only its beauty is featured in hand-drawn
  illustrations, but also the artwork are eco-friendly printed using Oeko Tex
  certified non toxic eco-friendly water-based reactive inks.</p><p>Made with
  Love in Bali</p>
