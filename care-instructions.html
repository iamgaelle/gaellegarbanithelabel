      <h2> Take care of your garment </h2>
      <p> Due to its natural material, it just needs a little bit of love and some extra care, because loved clothed last. </p>
      <p>Hand wash cold or machine wash cold using delicate cycle + air dry flat. 
        Do not bleach & do not tumble dry.
        </p>
      <p>Low heat and gently press iron - too much direct heat may scorch the fabric. 
        Recommended to iron inside out.
        </p>
      <p>Please note that tencel could potentially shrink about 2-3% with the first washing and will resist shrinking from then on. All GG garments have already been through one post print gentle wash cycle.</p>
      <p>We encourage you to wear your clothes more and to wash less so as to reduce your impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>We hope you appreciate our commitment to being as eco-responsible as we can with our pieces the care that has gone into each garment.</p>
