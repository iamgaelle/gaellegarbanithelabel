  <p>Our Karang Kimono is inspired by the Pink Beach in Komodo Island alongside
  the treasures that our Mother Ocean beholds: the word Karang literally
  translates to &ldquo;corals&rdquo; in the language of Bahasa in Indonesia. The
  soft and warm palette was selected to evoke dreamy visions of the tropical
  island lifestyle.</p><p>Embodying femininity and nature&rsquo;s beauty whilst
  effortlessly flowing with the breeze, this elegant kimono with a boho chic
  touch is the perfect cover up for your days chilling by the pool or at the
  beach. Or why not dress it up wearing it tight up with jeans or white
  trousers. The Karang Kimono is not only a versatile key piece to have in your
  day-to-day, holiday and travel wardrobe but also feels so soft with its silky
  touch and comfortable to wear.</p>
